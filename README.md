# -Smart-Airport-Ride-Pooling-Backend-System
A high-performance backend system that intelligently groups airport passengers into shared cabs while optimizing routes, pricing, and travel deviation constraints.  This system is designed to handle real-time ride requests, cancellations, and high concurrency with strict performance guarantees.

Build a backend system that:

1)Groups passengers into shared cabs
2)Respects luggage and seat capacity constraints
3)Minimizes total route deviation
4)Ensures passenger detour tolerance is not exceeded
5)Handles real-time cancellations
6)Supports 10,000 concurrent users
7)Processes 100+ requests per second
8)Maintains API latency under 300ms
